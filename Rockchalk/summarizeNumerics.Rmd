
summarizeNumerics Extracts numeric variables and presents an summary in a workable
format.

#### Description

Finds the numeric variables, and ignores the others. (See summarizeFactors for a function that
handles non-numeric variables). It will provide quantiles (specified probs as well as other summary
statistics, specified stats. Results are returned in a data frame. The main benefits from
this compared to R's default summary are 1) more summary information is returned for each variable
(dispersion), 2) the results are returned in a form that is easy to use in further analysis, 3) the
variables in the output may be alphabetized.

#### Usage
<pre><code>


summarizeNumerics(dat, alphaSort = FALSE, probs = c(0, 0.5, 1),
stats = c("mean", "sd", "skewness", "kurtosis", "nobs", "nmiss"),
na.rm = TRUE, unbiased = TRUE, digits = 2)


</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``dat`` a data frame or a matrix
* ``alphaSort`` If TRUE, the columns are re-organized in alphabetical order. If FALSE, they are
presented in the original order.
probs Controls calculation of quantiles (see the R quantile functionâs probs argument).
If FALSE or NULL, no quantile estimates are provided. Default is
c("min" = 0, "med" = 0.5, "max" = 1.0), which will appear in output
as ``c("min", "med", "max")``. Other values between 0 and 1 are allowed. For
example, ``c(0.3, 0.7)`` will appear in output as pctile_30% and pctile_70%.
* stats A vector including any of these: ``c("min","med", "max", "mean", "sd", "var", "skewness", "kurtosis",...)``,Default includes all except var. "nobs" means number of observations with nonmissing,
finite scores (not NA, NaN, -Inf, or Inf). "nmiss" is the number of cases
with values of NA. If FALSE or NULL, provide none of these.
na.rm default TRUE. Should missing data be removed to calculate summaries?
unbiased If TRUE (default), skewness and kurtosis are calculated with biased corrected
(N-1) divisor in the standard deviation.
digits Number of digits reported after decimal point. Default is 2

#### Value
a data.frame with one column per summary element (rows are the variables).
