lazyCor Create correlation matrices.

#### Description

Use can supply either a single value (the common correlation among all variables), a column of the
lower triangular values for a correlation matrix, or a candidate matrix. The function will check X
and do the right thing. If X is a matrix, check that it is a valid correlation matrix. If its a single
value, use that to fill up a matrix. If itis a vector, try to use it as a vech to fill the lower triangle..

#### Usage

lazyCor(X, d)
Arguments
X Required. May be one value, a vech, or a matrix
d Optional. The number of rows in the correlation matrix to be created. lazyCor
will deduce the desired size from X if possible. If X is a single value, d is a
required argument.
Value
A correlation matrix.
