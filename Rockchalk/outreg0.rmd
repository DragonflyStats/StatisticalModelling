outreg0 Creates a publication quality result table for regression models. outreg0
is the last version in the last development stream.

#### Description

outreg0 writes its output directly to the terminal, but does not create an output object. The new
version of this functionâwhich I wish you would try insteadâdoes the same work, but it also creates
an output object that can be transformed for other purposes.

#### Usage
<pre><code>


outreg0(modelList, title, label, modelLabels = NULL, varLabels = NULL,
tight = TRUE, showAIC = FALSE, float = FALSE, request, runFuns,
digits = 3, alpha = 0.05)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments

* ``modelList``: A regression model or an R list of regression models. If this is a named list, the names will be used as column labels, unless the argument modelLabels is supplied separately, which will override the names of modelList.
* ``title``:    A title to be displayed on the top of the LaTeX regression table.
* label A string to be used as a LaTeX label in the table to be created.
* modelLabels A vector of charater string variables, one for each element in modelList. Will
override the names in modelList.
* varLabels To beautify the parameter names printed. Must be a named vector in the format
c(parmname = "displayName", parmname = "displayName"). Include as many
parameters as desired, it is not necessary to supply new labels for all of the parameters. "displayName" must be valid laTeX. This feature is useful if your variable names have any illegal LaTeX characters, such as "$" or "\_".
* tight If TRUE, parameter estimates and standard errors are printed in a single column. If FALSE, parameter estimates and standard errors are printed side by side.
* showAIC If TRUE, the AIC estimate is included with the diagnostic values
* float Include boilerplate for a table float, with the tabular markup inside it.
* ``request``: Extra information to be retrieved from the summary(model) and displayed. This
must be a vector of named arguments, such as c(adj.r.squared = "adj $R^2$",
fstatistic = "F"). The name must be a valid name of the output object, the value
should be the label the user wants printed in the table. See details.
* runFuns A list of functions
* digits Default = 3. How many digits after decimal sign are to be displayed.
* alpha Default = 0.05. I think stars are dumb, but enough people have asked me for more stars that Iâm caving in. Enter c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001) to see what happens.

#### Details

This provides "markup" that the user is will copy into a LaTeX document. The table is a LaTeX
tabular environment, which can be enclosed in a table to obtain a "floating," automatically numbered
LaTeX document environment. The default will create the tabular-inside-a-table, but if only the
tabular is needed, use the argument float = FALSE. This can be called within Sweave documents.
The markup generated by the basic

#### Details
 may cause output that needs some hand-editing.
A LaTeX tabular object is created, with the floating table markup around it if requested (float =
TRUE).
The table include a minimally sufficient (in my opinion) model summary. For any fitted model,
outreg0() will present the parameter estimates and standard errors, and it will also scan the summary
of the object for some summary values and goodness of fit indicators. Some users may want more information. lm fits will not include output for the "fstatistic" that is reported in the lm's summary object, but users can ask for it with the argument request. Similarly, the argument runFuns can ask for additional diagnostic functions to be reported.
While outreg0() originally designed for models fitted by lm() and glm(), it will now work for any kind of regression model that has methods summary(), coef(), vcov() and nobs(). This will not succeed, however, if the regression modelâs summary function does not create an object that holds values in a workable structure (in the same way that lm() and glm() do). Please pressure
people who write R packages that claim to "do regression" to supply methods to do the basic work
that we need to compile tables.
Two types of customization 
arguments
 were introduced with rockchalk version 1.7.3. The new
arguments  are request and runFuns. Beta test reports are welcome!
The request argument supplies a list of names of summary output elements that are desired. The format is a pair, a value to be retrieved and a name to be printed for it. With the lm() regression, for example, one might want the output of the F test and the adjusted R-square. An example usage might
be request = c(adj.r.squared = "adj. $R^2", fstatistic = "F"). The names may be included
in quotation marks if the user desires to do so: request = c("adj.r.squared" = "adj. $R^2","fstatistic" = "F").
The value on the left is the name of the desired information in the summary object, while the value
on the right is any valid LaTeX markup that the user desires to display in the first column of the table. request terms that generate a single numerical value will generally work fine, while requests that ask for more structured information, such as the F test (including the 2 degrees of freedom values) are still a work in progress.

The runFuns argument is inspired by a user request: could this include the BIC or other summaries that some models report? We have to run the BIC function, and divert the result into the correct column of the result table. Any R function, whether supplied with and R package or in the useR's own code, may be used. This is a two-part specification, one representing the function to be run, the other representing the name that is desired in the output. For example, it might be runFuns =
c("AIC" = "Akaike Criterion", "BIC" = "Schwartz Criterion","logLik" = "LL").

### Value
None

### Note
There are many R packages that can be used to create LaTeX regression tables. memisc, texreg,
apsrtable, xtables, and rms are some. This "outreg" version was in use in our labs before we were
aware that those packages were in development. It is not intended as a competitor, it is just a slightly
different version of the same that is more suited to our needs.
