```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rockchalk)
```

Calculates the "center" quantiles, always including the median, when n is odd.

#### Description

If the numeric variable has fewer than 6 unique observed values, this will send the data to cutByTable.
The default return will find dividing points at three quantiles: c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75) If n=4, the dividing points will be c(0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80) If n=5, c(0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0) Larger n that are odd will include 0.5 and evenly spaced points out to proportions 0 and 1.0. Larger n that is even will return evenly spaced points calculated by R's pretty function.


#### Usage
<pre><code>


cutByQuantile(x, n = 3)

</code></pre>

n The number of quantile points. See
