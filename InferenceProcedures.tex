\begin{itemize}
\item Test for Equality of Test (\texttt{var.test()})
\item Welch Two Sample \emph{t-}test (\texttt{t.test()})
\item Independent Two Sample \emph{t-}test (\texttt{t.test(var.equal=TRUE)})

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bartlett's test for Homogeneity of Variances}
 

Equal variances across samples is called homogeneity of variances. Bartlett's test is used to test if multiple samples have equal variances. 

Some statistical tests, such as the analysis of variance, assume that variances are equal across groups or samples.  The Bartlett test can be used to verify that assumption.

\begin{itemize}
\item The null hypothesis is that each of the samples have equal variance.
\item The alternative hypothesis states that at least one sample has a significantly different variance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Inference Procedures}
\subsection{Confidence Interval }
A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data. If independent samples are taken repeatedly from the same population, and a confidence interval calculated for each sample, then a certain percentage (confidence level) of the intervals will include the unknown population parameter. 

Confidence intervals are usually calculated so that this percentage is $95\%$, but we can produce $90\%$, $99\%$, $99.9\%$ (or whatever) confidence intervals for the unknown parameter. The width of the confidence interval gives us some idea about how uncertain we are about the unknown parameter. A very wide interval may indicate that more data should be collected before anything very definite can be said about the parameter.
\subsection{Power }
The power of a statistical hypothesis test measures the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false - that is, to make a correct decision. In other words, the power of a hypothesis test is the probability of not committing a type II error. It is calculated by subtracting the probability of a type II error from 1, usually expressed as: 
\[\mbox{Power} = 1 - \mbox{P(type II error) } = 1- \beta \]The maximum power a test can have is 1, the minimum is 0. Ideally we want a test to have high power, close to 1.

\section{Single Sample Inference Procedures}
If we have a single sample we might want to answer several
questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the mean value? \item Is the mean value
	significantly different from current theory? (Hypothesis test)
	\item What is the level of uncertainty associated with our
	estimate of the mean value? (Confidence interval)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item (Last week : confidence interval for a mean) \item Revision:
	For large samples ($n > 30$) and/or if the population standard
	deviation ($\sigma$) is known, the usual test statistic is given
	by: \[Z =\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{SE(\bar{X})}\]
	
	\item $S.E.(\bar{X}) = { \sigma \over \sqrt{n}} $ or ${s \over \sqrt{n}}$. 
	\item For small samples, use the $t-$distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
	\item Critical value from tables.
	\item Compare test statistics and critical values.
\end{itemize}

To ensure that our analysis is correct we need to check for
outliers in the data (i.e. boxplots) and we also need to check
whether the data are normally distributed or not.

\begin{framed}
	\begin{verbatim}
	> t.test(X,mu=10)
	
	One Sample t-test
	
	data:  X 
	t = 14.1421, df = 4, p-value = 0.0001451
	alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 10 
	95 percent confidence interval:
	10.08037 10.11963 
	sample estimates:
	mean of x 
	10.1 
	\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsection{Hypothesis test of Proportion}
This procedure is used to assess whether an assumed proportion is supported by evidence. For two tailed tests, the null hypothesis states that the population proportion  π has a specified value, with the alternative stating that π has a different value. 

The hypotheses are typically as follows:   

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Ho] : $\pi = 0.50$
	\item[Ha] : $\pi \neq 0.50$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example}
A manufacturer is interested in whether people can tell the difference between a new formulation of a soft drink and the original formulation. The new formulation is cheaper to produce so if people cannot tell the difference, the new formulation will be manufactured. 

A sample of 100 people is taken. Each person is given a taste of both formulations and asked to identify the original. Sixty-two percent of the subjects correctly identified the new formulation. Is this proportion significantly different from $50\%$? 

The first step in hypothesis testing is to specify the null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. In testing proportions, the null hypothesis is that $\pi$, the proportion in the population, is equal to 0.5. The alternate hypothesis is $\pi \neq 0.5$. 

The computed p-values is compared to the pre-specified significance level of $5\%$. Since the p-value (0.0214) is less than the significance level of 0.05, the effect is statistically significant. 

\begin{verbatim}
> prop.test(62,100,0.5)

1-sample proportions test with continuity correction

data:  62 out of 100, null probability 0.5 
X-squared = 5.29, df = 1, p-value = 0.02145
alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
0.5170589 0.7136053 
sample estimates:
p 
0.62 
\end{verbatim}

Since the effect is significant, the null hypothesis is rejected. It is concluded that the proportion of people choosing the original formulation is greater than 0.50. 

This result might be described in a report as follows: 

\begin{quote}
	The proportion of subjects choosing the original formulation (0.62) was significantly greater than 0.50, with p-value = 0.021.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Two Sample Tests}


All of the previous hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be
extended to the two-sample case.

The same assumptions apply, i.e. data are normally distributed in
each population and we may want to test if the mean in one
population is the same as the mean in the other population, etc.

Normality can be checked using histograms, boxplots and Q-Q
plots as before. The Anderson-Darling test can be used on
each group of data also.


%------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Implementation}

This can be carried out in R by hand:

\footnotesize \begin{verbatim}
>obs.vals <- matrix(c(43,9,44,4), nrow=2, byrow=T)
>row.tots <- apply(obs.vals, 1, sum)
>col.tots <- apply(obs.vals, 2, sum)
>exp.vals <- row.tots%o%col.tots/sum(obs.vals)
>TS <- sum((obs.vals-exp.vals)^2/exp.vals)
>TS
>[1] 1.777415
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
