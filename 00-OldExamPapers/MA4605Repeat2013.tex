\subsection*{Question 5. (20 marks) Experimental Design Part 2 }
\begin{itemize} % Start of Question 5
\item[(a)] % Part A

In an investigation into the extraction of nitrate-nitrogen from air dried soil, three quantitative variables were investigated at two levels. These were the amount of oxidised activated charcoal (A) added to the extracting solution to remove organic interferences, the strength of CaSO4 extracting solution (C), and the time the soil was shaken with the solution (T). The aim of the investigation was to optimise the extraction procedure. The levels of the variables are given here:
\begin{center}
{

\begin{tabular}{|cc|c|c|}
\hline	&		&\phantom{sp}	{\LARGE -}\phantom{sp}	&	\phantom{sp} {\LARGE +} \phantom{sp}	\\ \hline
Activated charcoal (g) 	&	A 	&	0.5	&	1	\\ \hline
CaSO{4} (\%) 	&	C 	&	0.1	&	0.2	\\ \hline
Time (minutes) 	&	T 	&	30	&	60	\\ \hline
\end{tabular} 
}
\end{center}

The concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen were determined by ultra-violet spectrophotometry and compared with concentrations determined by a standard technique. The results are given below and are the amounts recovered (expressed as the percentage of known nitrate concentration).
