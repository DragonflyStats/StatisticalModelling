\subsection*{Question 1. (25 marks) Inference Procedures and Distributional Testing}
\subsubsection*{Question 1 Part A (15 Marks)}
% Clincal 

A test of a specific blood factor has been devised such that, for adults in Western Europe, the test score is normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 10. A clinical research organization is carrying out research on the blood factor levels for sufferers of a particular disease.  

\begin{itemize}
\item A study has obtained the following test scores for 14 randomly selected patients suffering from the disease in Ireland 
\[ \{118, 116, 109, 105, 103, 111, 139, 117, 107, 105, 125,  99, 106, 103\}\]

\item A similar study has obtained the following test scores for 14 randomly selected patients suffering from the disease in Denmark.
\[\{120, 140, 112, 109, 114, 116,  99, 108, 109, 111, 109, 131, 117, 101\}\]

\end{itemize}

% The variance of both data sets are equal. 
% You may assume that both data sets are normally distributed.

\subsection*{Question 4. (25 marks) Experimental Design }


\subsubsection*{Question 4 Part A (25 Marks)}

	In an investigation into the extraction of nitrate-nitrogen from air dried soil, three quantitative variables were investigated at two levels. These were the amount of oxidised activated charcoal (A) added to the extracting solution to remove organic interferences, the strength of CaSO4 extracting solution (C), and the time the soil was shaken with the solution (T). The aim of the investigation was to optimise the extraction procedure. The levels of the variables are given here:

			\end{tabular} 
		}
	\end{center}
	
%\noindent 	The concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen were determined by ultra-violet spectrophotometry and compared with concentrations determined by a standard technique.

\subsubsection*{Question 5 Part C (12 Marks)}
% \subsection*{Question 47 - Nelson Rules for Control Charts}
The \textbf{Nelson Rules} are a set of eight decision rules for detecting ``out-of-control" or non-random conditions on control charts. These rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] ($4 \times 3$ Marks) Discuss any four of these rules, and how they would be used to detect ``out of control" processes. Support your answer with sketch.
